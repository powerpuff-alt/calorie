Welcome to the Calorie Calculator – a simple and effective web tool designed to help you estimate your daily calorie needs based on your personal information and lifestyle. Whether you're trying to lose weight, maintain your current weight, or gain muscle, our calculator gives you a good starting point.

🔍 What It Does
This website calculates the number of calories you need per day using standard formulas like the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation. It takes into account:

Your age

Your weight and height

Your activity level

With this information, it gives you an estimate of how many calories you should consume daily.

⚙️ How It Works
You fill out a form with your personal data.

The site processes your inputs and calculates your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR).

It then adjusts the result based on your physical activity level to give your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE).

You’ll get recommended calorie ranges depending on your goal: weight loss, maintenance, or muscle gain.

🌐 Who It's For
This site is for anyone who wants to:

Understand their daily energy needs

Set realistic fitness and diet goals

Make healthier lifestyle choices
